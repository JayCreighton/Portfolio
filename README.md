I've selected these projects to provide a sampling of the diverse analyses that I have performed in my personal, professional, and educational pursuits.

## Restaurant Analysis
I spent a lot of time bartending and waiting tables to help make ends meet while I was a fishing guide, working on my MBA, teaching skiing, and and exploring entrepreneurial pursuits. 

Just note that the focus of this project is a significant portion of my income from several years ago. Many people are uncomfortable talking discussing specific numbers, but I live my life open source.
